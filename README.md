# StockTrader
This program uses diffrent day trader methods like SMA, MACD, RSI, and more to buy and sell stocks. After running this model on past data it proved to work quite well. I tested it on JNJ and it made a some profit. 

# SMA_Stock_Trader:

Stock being used is JNJ

Potential Profit $59

Total take away $219

# Notes
As you can see both Stock Trading Systems work ok, but there is much room for improvement. SMA_Stock_Trader is much simpler and can be scaled down to day trading. (Not yearly trading). This can prove to be much more profitable. All the other Trading programs in the repo are quite bad and some don't even work fully. If you want a profitable trading bot I would defensibly use SMA_Stock_Trader. It only uses Simple Moving Averages to make the decisions on weather to buy or sell. This code works best on constant realiable stocks. If a stock is crashing hard you will lose money, if the stock is going insanely high you won't make as much profit if you just bought and held.
