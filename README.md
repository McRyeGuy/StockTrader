# StockTrader
This program uses diffrent day trader methods like SMA, MACD, RSI, and more to buy and sell stocks. After running this model on past data it proved to work quite well. I tested it on JNJ and it made a some profit. 

# SMA_Stock_Trader:

Note: I am trying to fix the problem of not selling when the stock goes way down and not buying more when the stock goes way up. I will update this repo when I find a solution. In the mean time use this code for steady stocks like JNJ, not Tesla or Amazon. This will improve you chances of profit and make your profit more stable for longer periods of time.

# Notes
As you can see both Stock Trading Systems work ok, but there is room for improvement. SMA_Stock_Trader is much simpler and can be scaled down to day trading. (Not yearly trading). This can prove to be much more profitable. All the other Trading programs in the repo are quite bad and some don't even work fully. If you want a profitable trading bot I would defensibly use SMA_Stock_Trader. It only uses Simple Moving Averages to make the decisions on weather to buy or sell. This code works best on constant realiable stocks. If a stock is crashing hard you will lose money, if the stock is going insanely high you won't make as much profit if you just bought and held.

# Warnings
I am not a financial advisor. I am merely a 16-year old who wants to make money in the stock market. Don't invest any money that you are not willing to lose. I have gain my knowledge by YouTube video and stack overflow. I HAVE NEVER TAKEN A FINANCIAL CLASS OR A FULL PROGRAMMING CLASS.
